# cuny-data-607-project-3
Repo to collaborate for project 3

Original data from kaggle:

* original_job_postings.csv
* original_job_skills.csv
* original_job_summary.csv


`Project3_DATA607_JobSkills.Rmd` is the code that pulls in the original csvs and creates normalized datasets.

Normalized datasets:

* job_postings_norm.csv
* job_postings_with_skills.csv
* sep_skills.csv

`Project3_DATA607_JobSkills_Part_2.Rmd` contains the tidying, transforming and analysis code.

The `old_versions` folder is where older versions of our code exist.
